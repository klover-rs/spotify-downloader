# spotify-downloader
A Project which allows you to download spotify songs if you have a premium account!

## How to build
### prerequisites
- [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
- if you encounter issues with building, make yourself familiar with the tauri api :)

1. clone the repo
2. run in the root directory of the repo `npm i`
3. then run `npm run tauri dev` to start debugging the application or `npm run tauri build`to build the release version of the application

## How to use
yea what can i say, its very easy to use, you will understand how it works once you see it.

i should mention tho, that you need your spotify username and password to download tracks, as mentioned earlier, **a premium account is required**.

your username is NOT YOUR NICKNAME.
